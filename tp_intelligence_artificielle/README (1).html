		<p>The problem is to learn a function mapping examples into two classes: positive and negative. We are given a database of examples already classified as positive or negative.
			Concept learning: the process of inducing a function mapping input examples into a Boolean output. </p>
		<h2 id="overview-of-the-data">Overview of the data</h2>
		<hr/>
		<p>This data set consists of 101 animals from a zoo. There are 
			<strong>16 variables</strong> with various traits to describe the animals. The 
			<strong>7 Class Types</strong> are: Mammal, Bird, Reptile, Fish, Amphibian, Bug and Invertebrate
		</p>
		<p>The purpose for this data set is to be able to predict the classification of the animals, based upon the variables. 
			There are 2 files:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>zoo.csv: attribute Information: (name of attribute and type of value domain)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>animal_name: Unique for each instance</li>

				<li>Animal_Names character -- The list of the animals that fall in the category of the class</li>

		<h2 id="candidate-elimination-algorithm">Candidate Elimination algorithm</h2>
		<hr/>
		<p>It incrementally builds the version space given a hypothesis space H and a set E of examples. The examples are added one by one; each example possibly shrinks the version space by removing the hypotheses that are inconsistent with the example. The candidate elimination algorithm does this by updating the general and specific boundary for each new example. </p>

			<strong>Approach:</strong>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>According to the training data there were 7 classes into which animals were classified.</li>
			<li>In the training data first we considered all the instances with classification as class 1 as positive and rest as negative.</li>
			<li>Now to generate the specific boundary we first considered only the positive examples and neglected the negative examples. Hence the specific boundary was generated using the Candidate Elimination Algorithm. Then we generated the general boundary considering the negative examples using the algorithm.</li>
			<li>The same logic was repeated for all the classes.</li>
		</ol>

			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>the training date</li>

				<li>genericBoundary is a list of
